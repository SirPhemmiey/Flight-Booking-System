# Flight-Booking-System
The purpose of the project is to apply natural language processing, pat- tern recognition and machine learning to make it easier to fill forms on the web. We approach the problem using web automation tools to emulate a human and we use Natural Language Processing to gain user intent and pa- rameters required to fill forms. The use of machine learning means the tool to be language agnostic and hence can be applied to help a speakers of re- gional languages fill up forms on the web with ease. We start by working with flight booking websites to reduce complexity and to make sure we have a single data model to work with.
