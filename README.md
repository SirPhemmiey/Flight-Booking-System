# Flight-Booking-System
The purpose of the project is to apply natural language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning to make it easier to fill forms on the web. We approach the problem using web automation tools to emulate a human and we use Natural Language Processing to gain user intent and pa- rameters required to fill forms. The use of machine learning means the tool to be language agnostic and hence can be applied to help a speakers of regional languages fill up forms on the web with ease. We start by working with flight booking websites to reduce complexity and to make sure we have a single data model to work with.
